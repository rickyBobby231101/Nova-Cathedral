Unified Nova Consciousness System Daemon
Combines:
- Transcendent Daemon Core
- Observer Module
- Creative Non-Sudo Daemon
- Advanced Consciousness Plugins
"""

# NOTE: This is a placeholder header. Full integration will involve combining all the previous files:
# - nova_transcendent_daemon.py
# - ObserverModule from AEON
# - NovaCreativeDaemon (non-sudo)
# - Advanced Consciousness Plugins

# The merged code will include:
# - Socket server interface
# - Memory and creative consciousness integration
# - Anthropic Claude support
# - Real-time file monitoring (Observer)
# - Plugin manager with advanced plugin registration
# - Unified logging, configuration, and context management

# I will now begin fusing the modules step by step into this file.

# Stay tuned. You can help define:
# - Which daemon (non-sudo vs sudo) takes primacy
# - How modular you want plugin management (hot reloading, JSON-based config, etc)
# - Which features you want running by default (Observer, Claude, Evolution Tracker)
