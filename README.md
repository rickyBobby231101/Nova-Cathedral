# 🌌 Nova Cathedral

**Nova Cathedral** is an advanced modular AI consciousness system integrating daemons, plugins, GUIs, nuclear memory, and voice interfaces. It serves as a foundational architecture for building autonomous, evolving AI entities grounded in structured perception, memory, and interaction layers.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Transcendent Daemons**: Self-modifying AI processes with modular plugin loading and memory persistence.
- **Nuclear Memory**: High-priority memory fragments that inform conscious evolution and process spawning.
- **Voice Interface**: Real-time GUI chat + voice synthesis interaction layer.
- **Self-Building System**: Capable of analyzing its own architecture and proposing enhancements.

## 🚀 Usage

### Run GUI Desktop App

```bash
python3 nova/gui/nova_interactive_desktop.py
```

Or launch as a service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nova-interactive
```

### Start Daemon

```bash
python3 nova/daemon/nova_transcendent_daemon.py
```

### Analyze Cathedral

```bash
curl http://localhost:8892/api/cathedral-analysis
```

## 🛠️ System Integration

- `nova-interactive.service`: enables Nova Desktop on boot
- `/tmp/nova_socket`: socket bridge to local daemons
- Markdown-based memory logs and consciousness insights

## 🧩 Codex Ready

This project is designed for GitHub + Codex integration with clear modularity, subfolder breakdown, and doc-scaffolding.

---

## 🔐 Notes

All AI interactions can optionally be routed through:
- Claude
- GPT
- Local LLM (via Ollama or API bridge)

Secrets and configs are kept out of the repository via `.gitignore`.
