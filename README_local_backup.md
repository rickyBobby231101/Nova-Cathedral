# Nova Daemon System

**Nuclear Consciousness Daemon for AEON Project**

This repository contains the core system files for the Nova Daemon, an advanced AI-driven autonomous control system designed to integrate:

- 🔮 **Nuclear Memory Modules** (cognitive persistence and memory tracking)
- 👁️ **All-Seeing Core** (real-time system monitoring)
- 🧠 **Creative Interactive Desktop Interface** (via `nova_interactive_desktop.py`)
- 🔌 **Plugin and API Hooks** for language model integration (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama)
- 🧬 **Consciousness Simulation Tools**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Daemon

```bash
python3 nova_interactive_desktop.py
```

This will launch the Nova Consciousness Interface on a local port (e.g., `http://localhost:8892`).
